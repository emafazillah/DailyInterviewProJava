 * Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:
 * 
 * You are given a binary tree representation of an arithmetic expression. In this tree, each leaf is an integer value,, and a non-leaf node is one of the four operations: '+', '-', '*', or '/'.
 * 
 * Write a function that takes this tree and evaluates the expression.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 *        *
 *       / \
 *      +    +
 *     / \  / \
 *    3  2  4  5
 *    
 * This is a representation of the expression (3 + 2) * (4 + 5), and should return 45.

 * A fixed point in a list is where the value is equal to its index. 
 * So for example the list [-5, 1, 3, 4], 1 is a fixed point in the list since the index and value is the same. 
 * Find a fixed point (there can be many, just return 1) in a sorted list of distinct elements, or return None if it doesn't exist.

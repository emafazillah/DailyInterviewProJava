 * A look-and-say sequence is defined as the integer sequence beginning with a single digit in which the next term is obtained by describing the previous term. 
 * An example is easier to understand:
 * 
 * Each consecutive value describes the prior value.
 * 
 * 1      #
 * 11     # one 1's
 * 21     # two 1's
 * 1211   # one 2, and one 1.
 * 111221 # #one 1, one 2, and two 1's.
 * 
 * Your task is, return the nth term of this sequence.

 * You are given an array of intervals - that is, an array of tuples (start, end). The array may not be sorted, and could contain overlapping intervals. 
 * Return another array where the overlapping intervals are merged.
 * 
 * For example:
 * [(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)]
 * 
 * This input should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)] since (5, 8) and (4, 10) can be merged into (4, 10).

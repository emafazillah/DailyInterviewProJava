 * A maze is a matrix where each cell can either be a 0 or 1. A 0 represents that the cell is empty, and a 1 represents a wall that cannot be walked through. 
 * You can also only travel either right or down.
 * 
 * Given a nxm matrix, find the number of ways someone can go from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. You can assume the two corners will always be 0.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
 * # 0 1 0
 * # 0 0 1
 * # 0 0 0
 * Output: 2
 * The two paths that can only be taken in the above example are: down -> right -> down -> right, and down -> down -> right -> right.

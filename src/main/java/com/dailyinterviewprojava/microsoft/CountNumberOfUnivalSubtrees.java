 * A unival tree is a tree where all the nodes have the same value. Given a binary tree, return the number of unival subtrees in the tree.
 * 
 * For example, the following tree should return 5:
 * 
 *        0
 *       / \
 *      1   0
 *     / \
 *    1   0
 *   / \
 *  1   1
 *  
 *  The 5 trees are:
 *  - The three single '1' leaf nodes. (+3)
 *  - The single '0' leaf node. (+1)
 *  - The [1, 1, 1] tree at the bottom. (+1)

 * Given a valid parenthesis string (with only '(' and ')', an open parenthesis will always end with a close parenthesis, and a close parenthesis will never start first), remove the outermost layers of the parenthesis string and return the new parenthesis string.
 * 
 * If the string has multiple outer layer parenthesis (ie (())()), remove all outer layers and construct the new string. So in the example, the string can be broken down into (()) + (). By removing both components outer layer we are left with () + '' which is simply (), thus the answer for that input would be ().

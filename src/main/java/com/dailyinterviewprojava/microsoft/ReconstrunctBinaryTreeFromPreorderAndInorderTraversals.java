 * You are given the preorder and inorder traversals of a binary tree in the form of arrays. 
 * Write a function that reconstructs the tree represented by these traversals.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Preorder: [a, b, d, e, c, f, g]
 * Inorder: [d, b, e, a, f, c, g]
 * 
 * The tree that should be constructed from these traversals is:
 * 
 *     a
 *    / \
 *   b   c
 *  / \ / \
 * d  e f  g

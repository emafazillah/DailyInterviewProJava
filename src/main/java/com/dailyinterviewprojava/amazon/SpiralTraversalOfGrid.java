 * You are given a 2D array of integers. Print out the clockwise spiral traversal of the matrix.
 * 
 * Example:
 * grid = [[1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
 *         [6,  7,  8,  9,  10],
 *         [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
 *         [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
 *         
 * The clockwise spiral traversal of this array is:
 * 
 * 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 13, 12

 * You are given a list of n numbers, where every number is at most k indexes away from its properly sorted index. Write a sorting algorithm (that will be given the number k) for this list that can solve this in O(n log k)
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: [3, 2, 6, 5, 4], k=2
 * Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 * As seen above, every number is at most 2 indexes away from its proper sorted index.

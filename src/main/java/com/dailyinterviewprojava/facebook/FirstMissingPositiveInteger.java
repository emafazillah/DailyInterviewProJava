 * You are given an array of integers. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array. 
 * The array may contain duplicate entries.
 * 
 * For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should return 2 because it is the smallest positive integer that doesn't exist in the array.
 * 
 * Your solution should run in linear time and use constant space.

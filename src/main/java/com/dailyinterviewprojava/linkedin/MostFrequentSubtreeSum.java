 * Given a binary tree, find the most frequent subtree sum.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 *    3
 *   / \
 *  1   -3
 *  
 *  The above tree has 3 subtrees. The root node with 3, and the 2 leaf nodes, which gives us a total of 3 subtree sums. The root node has a sum of 1 (3 + 1 + -3), the left leaf node has a sum of 1, and the right leaf node has a sum of -3. Therefore the most frequent subtree sum is 1.
 *  
 *  If there is a tie between the most frequent sum, you can return any one of them.

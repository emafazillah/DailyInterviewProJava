 * Given two strings, determine the edit distance between them. 
 * The edit distance is defined as the minimum number of edits (insertion, deletion, or substitution) needed to change one string to the other.
 *
 * For example, "biting" and "sitting" have an edit distance of 2 (substitute b for s, and insert a t).

 * Given a string with only ( and ), find the minimum number of characters to add or subtract to fix the string such that the brackets are balanced.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: '(()()'
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * The fixed string could either be ()() by deleting the first bracket, or (()()) by adding a bracket. These are not the only ways of fixing the string, there are many other ways by adding it in different positions!
